##### 1-A: Size of Ceramics

###### Questions to explore:
I want to know the actual size of a ceramic object and compare it with other objects. When visiting a museum, we can feel the size of an object from a single glance. However, it is hard when we view these ceramics online with a self-reliant picture on the screen.

###### Dataset:
Online Media + CC0 +Ceramic -Drawings

###### property and data points:
Extent Smithsonian, 1927

###### Visualization method:
Images gallery and 3d VR rendering
To provide an intuitive feeling of the size, using the gallery to display items next to another item will help users compare. Moreover, 3d VR technology will enable users to see it in physical space.
