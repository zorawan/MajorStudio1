# Data Visualization Major Studio 1 Fall 2021
This is my first assignment for Major Studio

<h3>Main Goal: </3>
Create a visualization to show the data from iris_json file.

<h3>My Idea: </3>
Using a bar chart to show the sizes of all the iris flowers in order to compare each of them. And with their Species lables showing as visual cue, we can compare the size of iris species.

<h3>My Approch:</3>
  1. Conculare petallength + petalwidth + sepallength + sepalwidth = iris size
  2. Map data to addChildToViz(item)
  3. Defind three colors for species. in newChild
  4. Append newChild
